This repository contains my practical code for Semester 3. The practicals cover various topics, and I've implemented solutions using Python and C++. As I progress through the semester, I'll keep adding new practicals to this repository.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference. If you have any suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to contribute. Happy coding!
